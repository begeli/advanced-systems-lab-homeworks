# Advanced Systems Lab Homeworks
My solutions for ETH Zurich Advanced Systems Lab homeworks. Homeworks were about analyzing performance of given code and applying optimization techniques learnt in class.

## The homework topics are as follows:
**Homework 1:** Cost, Performance and Operational Intensity Bound Anaylsis, ILP Analysis 

**Homework 2:** Applying standard C optimizations, Implementing Microbenchmarks to measure gap and latency of operations

* The optimized code for managed to speedup the baseline implementation by **20.21** times

**Homework 3:** Vectorization with Intel AVX intrinsics (Optimizing FIR filters, vector addition and complex conversion)\
* The vector implementation of FIR filters speedup the optimized implementation by **2.666** times\
* The vector implementation of vector addition speedup the optimized implementation by **3.568** times

**Homework 4:** Cache Associativity, Cachme Miss Analysis, Roofline Models
